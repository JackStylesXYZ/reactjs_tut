# Working Examples

### Javascript

In this example we will be using javascript to create a new div and append that as a child to an existing div within the DOM.

For the code please look at the folder `Examples/1_Javascript`

We have a simple html document containing a single div within the body tag - this div has the id of ***"root"***, and a script tag following the body tag containing our javascript code for this example.

### pseudo code...
```
1 - grab the div with the id of "root"
2 - create a new div element
3 - add some text the the new div - "Hello, world!"
4 - add a classname to the new div
5 - append the new div to the div with id of "root"
```

### Javascript code...
```
  1 - const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
  2 - const element = document.createElement('div')
  3 - element.textContent = 'Hello, world!'
  4 - element.className = 'data-javascript-only'
  5 - rootElement.appendChild(element)
```
